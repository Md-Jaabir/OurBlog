    <h1>Top 5 chess opening principles that you must know. </h1>
    <p>The opening stage of a chess game is critical because it sets the tone for the rest of the game. Following these
      principles will give you a better chance of getting a good position in the opening and ultimately lead you to
      victory.</p>
    <img src="../assets/p1.png" alt="Principal one" class="main-image">
    <h2>1. Control the Center</h2>
    <p>Controlling the center is crucial in the opening stage of a chess game. The central squares (E4, E5, D4, and D5)
      are the most important squares in the game, and whoever controls these squares has an early advantage. You should
      try to occupy these squares with your pawns or pieces as early as possible.
    </p>
    <img src="../assets/p2.png" alt="Principal two" class="main-image">
    <h2>2. Develop Your Pieces</h2>
    <p>Developing your pieces is essential to creating a strong position in the opening. The more pieces you have in
      play, the more options you have for attacking your opponent's position. Try to develop your pieces quickly and
      efficiently, and avoid moving the same piece multiple times in the opening.</p>
    <img src="../assets/p3.png" alt="Principal three" class="main-image">
    <h2>3. Castle Your King</h2>
    <p>Castling your king is an essential defensive move in the opening. By doing so, you put your king in a safe
      position and connect your rooks. Castling should be done as early as possible, preferably before any major attacks
      are launched by your opponent.</p>
    <img src="../assets/p4.png" alt="Principal four" class="main-image">
    <h2>4. Connect Your Rooks</h2>
    <p>Connecting your rooks is another key element of the opening. Once you have developed your pieces and castled your
      king, you should aim to connect your rooks. This means moving your king's rook to the center file (either the D or
      E file) and then moving your queen's rook to the same file. Connecting your rooks allows them to protect each
      other and control important open files.</p>
    <img src="../assets/p5.png" alt="Principal five" class="main-image">
    <h2>5. Don't Bring Your Queen Out Too Early</h2>
    <p>The queen is the most powerful piece on the board, but bringing it out too early can be risky. In the opening,
      you should focus on developing your minor pieces first, and only bring your queen out when it can be supported by
      your other pieces. If you bring your queen out too early, it can become a target for your opponent's pieces and
      disrupt your position.</p>
    <p>In addition to these five principles, it's important to remember that flexibility and adaptability are also
      essential in the opening. Your opponent may make unexpected moves, so be prepared to adjust your strategy
      accordingly. Finally, it's essential to study and practice openings regularly to improve your understanding of the
      game and develop your own opening repertoire.</p>
